To run ts file with classes
 
tsc filename.ts
node filename.js

in case  Accessors are only available when targeting ECMAScript 5 and higher.

For normal file without classes
direct run 
node filename.ts

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems. Design patterns also provide us with a common vocabulary to describe solutions. Patterns are proven solutions. They have less impact on the codebase. The term "design" is used with a strong aspect of the software product's behaviour as recognized by end-users.

These patterns can be used to solve smaller problems throughout the application, and are much easier to inject, change, and add than the overall architecture. Patterns can be easily reused. 



You should brush up on JavaScript, TS, Python, and angular design patterns. 



Algorithm vs Design pattern

An algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution.



Architecture Design patterns:

Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or any other structures. All architectures are designs but not all designs are architectures. Architectural Patterns have an extensive impact on the codebase.

The technical structure of software, i. e. the components, libraries, protocols and whatever it needs to fulfil the design. Architectural elements tend towards collections of classes or modules, generally represented as boxes.

You must have knowledge of these patterns.

Creational Design Patterns: 

handling object creation mechanisms.

Constructor

Factory (Method - Virtual Constructor)

Abstract

Structural Design Patterns:  

it includes object composition and typically identifies simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.

Some behavioural patterns include: 

Iterator, Mediator, Observer, Visitor, State, Chain of Responsibility, Command, Memento, Strategy, Template Method

Concurrency Design Patterns
These types of design patterns deal with multi-threaded programming paradigms.
Active object
Nuclear reaction
